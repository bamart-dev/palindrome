# Ada C23 - PSE 04: Palindrome
### Problem Statement
Imagine working on software that processes text. A palindrome is a word,
phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward.

Create a function called `palindrome` that determines if a string is
a palindrome. This method should take in one string as a parameter.
This method should return `True` if the string is a palindrome.

#### Example
| Original string as parameter | Is it a palindrome? |
| :--------------------------- | :------------------ |
| `"Hello, world!"`            | No                  |
| `"racecar"`                  | Yes                 |
| `"noon"`                     | Yes                 |
| `"mom"`                      | Yes                 |
| `"kayak"`                    | Yes                 |
